Something about myself: 

          After 24 years of my life, I finally realized what I want to do. 
          While I was studying at the university, I managed to get a job 
          in one of the largest advertising agencies, where I planned to 
          build my career, but all the time I looked towards development 
          and envied those who at least understand something about it. 
          One day, I decided that observe those who study development
          was not enough, and here I am, trying to conquer this peak.   
          
Skills:

          My most important skill is a great desire to learn new things and 
          the speed of assimilation of the material.
